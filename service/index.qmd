## AI Operation Lab — Enterprise Adoption Service

> Make AI an organizational capability, not just a tool.

## AI Challenges Enterprises Face Today

| Challenge | Root Cause |
|-----------|-----------|
| Too many tools, don't know how to use them | Lack of operation methodology |
| Employees can prompt AI, but can't produce value | Lack of systematic processes |
| AI projects can't demonstrate ROI | Lack of measurement standards |
| Technology changes too fast, high adoption risk | Lack of evolution mechanisms |

> The problem isn't AI — it's the lack of an "AI operating system."
