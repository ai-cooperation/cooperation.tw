## What is Skill?

We define a standard structure for AI skill modules:

```
skill-{name}/
├── module.yaml       # Contract: inputs, outputs, pipeline
├── skills/           # AI agent behavior specs
├── reference/        # Domain knowledge base
├── tools/            # Executable scripts
├── examples/         # Working demonstrations
└── README.md
```

Any AI framework that supports tool-use (LangChain, CrewAI, Claude, OpenAI Assistants) can integrate Skill modules.

## Build Your Own Skill

1. Clone the [skill template](https://github.com/ai-cooperation/openspec/tree/main/examples/minimal-skill)
2. Define your `module.yaml`
3. Write your skills and reference docs
4. Add examples
5. Validate with `python3 validate.py your-skill/`
