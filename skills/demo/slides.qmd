## Layout 1: Title and Content

### AI Operation Lab — Structured Capability Building

- **L1 — Learning Environment**: Dare to use, know how to use, don't fear mistakes → "I don't know how to start"
- **L2 — Operation Method**: Design AI work methods → "AI can't really help me"
- **L3 — Evolution Path**: Build continuous evolution capability → "How to not be replaced by AI"

Each layer builds on the previous, forming a sustainable AI capability growth system.

Layout: Title and Content.
Trigger: Heading + text-only content (no columns, no images).

**Purpose & Pain Points**

- Dare to use → "I don't know how to start"
- Design AI work → "AI can't help me"
- Continuous evolution → "How not to be replaced"

## Layout 4: Content with Caption

The three-layer architecture is the core design philosophy of AI Operation Lab. From individual "dare to use" to organizational "continuous evolution", each layer solves specific enterprise AI adoption pain points. L1 builds safe environments, L2 builds methodology, L3 builds evolution paths.

## Background Image + Title {background-image="collaboration.jpg" background-size="cover" background-opacity="0.6"}

**Three-Layer Architecture — L1 · L2 · L3**

From "dare to use" → "know how to use" → "continuous evolution"

::: {.notes}
Layout: Title and Content + background-image.
Background image fills the slide in stretch mode, text overlaid on top.
