## Layout 1: Title and Content

### AI Operation Lab — Structured Capability Building

- **L1 — Learning Environment**: Dare to use, know how to use, don't fear mistakes → "I don't know how to start"
- **L2 — Operation Method**: Design AI work methods → "AI can't really help me"
- **L3 — Evolution Path**: Build continuous evolution capability → "How to not be replaced by AI"

Each layer builds on the previous, forming a sustainable AI capability growth system.

::: {.notes}
Layout: Title and Content.
Trigger: Heading + text-only content (no columns, no images).
:::

## Layout 2: Two Content {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

**Layers**

- **L1** Learning Environment
- **L2** Operation Method
- **L3** Evolution Path

:::
::: {.column width="50%"}

**Purpose & Pain Points**

- Dare to use → "I don't know how to start"
- Design AI work → "AI can't help me"
- Continuous evolution → "How not to be replaced"

:::
::::

::: {.notes}
Layout: Two Content.
Trigger: columns syntax with text-only in both columns.
:::

## Layout 3a: Comparison (both columns with images)

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

**Enterprise Pain Points**

:::
::::

::: {.notes}
Layout: Comparison.
Trigger: columns with at least one column containing text + image.

Image source: AI-generated images (bundled stock library).
:::

## Layout 3b: Comparison (image left, text right)

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

**Team Collaboration**

**AI Operation Lab Architecture**

- **L1** Safe Learning Environment
- **L2** AI Work Methodology
- **L3** Organization Evolution Path

Each layer builds on the previous.

:::
::::

::: {.notes}
Layout: Comparison (image-text variant).
Trigger: Both columns contain text + non-text content.
Left: image + header, Right: text content.
postprocess.py restores vertical centering.

## Layout 4a: Content with Caption

The three-layer architecture is the core design philosophy of AI Operation Lab. From individual "dare to use" to organizational "continuous evolution", each layer solves specific enterprise AI adoption pain points. L1 builds safe environments, L2 builds methodology, L3 builds evolution paths.

![](teamwork.jpg){height="320px"}

::: {.notes}
Layout: Content with Caption.
Trigger: text paragraph followed by image (no columns).

Image source: AI-generated (bundled stock library).
:::

## Layout 4b: Title + Image (top-bottom)

![](team-meeting.jpg){height="480px"}

::: {.notes}
Layout: Title and Content (image variant).
Trigger: Heading followed by image only, no text paragraph.
Creates a "title on top, image below" visual — different from Content with Caption (left-right).

## Layout 4c: Four Quadrants (diagonal) {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

**L1 Safe Learning Environment**

:::
::: {.column width="50%"}

![](coding-screen.jpg){height="220px"}

**L3 Organization Evolution Path**

:::
::::

::: {.notes}
Layout: Comparison (four-quadrant variant).
Trigger: Both columns contain text + image.
Left: text-top/image-bottom, Right: image-top/text-bottom → diagonal symmetry.
postprocess.py repositions into 4 equal quadrants.

Image source: AI-generated (bundled stock library).
:::

## {background-image="ai-brain.jpg" background-size="cover"}

::: {.notes}
Layout: Blank + background-image.
Trigger: Slide with only non-breaking space content and background-image attribute.
Full-bleed background for visual impact pages or section transitions.

## Background Image + Title {background-image="collaboration.jpg" background-size="cover" background-opacity="0.6"}

**Three-Layer Architecture — L1 · L2 · L3**

From "dare to use" → "know how to use" → "continuous evolution"

::: {.notes}
Layout: Title and Content + background-image.
Background image fills the slide in stretch mode, text overlaid on top.

**Pandoc Auto-Selected Layouts**

- **Title and Content** — Text-only / title + image
- **Two Content** — Two-column text
- **Comparison** — Both with images / image-text / 4 quadrants
- **Content with Caption** — Text + image (left-right)
- **Blank** — Background image (no title)

:::
::: {.column width="50%"}

**Trigger Conditions & Variants**

- Text only → Title and Content
