## What is AI Operation?

AI Operation is not about running AI models. It's about designing how humans and AI collaborate in structured, repeatable, and improvable ways.

> **AI Operation = Designing how humans structure tasks, workflows, and roles to make AI a controllable, learnable, and evolvable partner.**

## Core Question

The central question of AI Operation is:

> Given a task, how should we divide work between humans and AI, structure the workflow, define quality criteria, and enable continuous improvement?

## Three Pillars

### 1. Task Design

- **Decomposition** — Break complex work into AI-executable steps
- **Role Assignment** — Define what humans do vs. what AI does
- **Quality Boundaries** — Set acceptance criteria for AI outputs
- **Error Handling** — Design feedback loops for when AI gets it wrong

### 2. Process Architecture

- **Pipeline Design** — Chain multiple AI steps into a coherent workflow
- **Human Checkpoints** — Where humans review, approve, or redirect
- **State Management** — Track what's done, what's pending, what failed
- **Iteration Protocol** — How to improve outputs across cycles

### 3. Capability Evolution

- **Skill Modules** — Encapsulate proven AI workflows as reusable modules
- **Knowledge Codification** — Turn tribal knowledge into machine-readable reference docs
- **Maturity Assessment** — Measure how effectively the organization uses AI
- **Continuous Learning** — Update skills and processes as AI capabilities evolve

## Why This Matters

Without AI Operation methodology:

| Symptom | Root Cause |
|---------|-----------|
| "AI doesn't help us" | No task decomposition |
| "Results are inconsistent" | No quality boundaries |
| "We can't scale AI use" | No process architecture |
| "We keep starting over" | No capability evolution |
