## AI Operation Design Principles

These principles guide every decision in the AI Cooperation framework.

### 1. Structure Enables Freedom

AI agents perform best within clear boundaries. Defining inputs, outputs, and constraints doesn't limit creativity — it enables reliable, repeatable results.

### 2. Separate Knowledge from Behavior

- **Skills** define WHAT the agent should do
- **Reference docs** define HOW to do it
- **Prompts** define WHO the agent is

This separation allows independent evolution of each component.

### 3. Human-in-the-Loop by Design

AI should augment human capability, not replace human judgment. Every pipeline should have explicit human checkpoints for review, approval, or redirection.

### 4. Modules Over Monoliths

Complex AI workflows should be composed of small, reusable, independently testable modules. Each module follows a standardized structure with clear contracts.

### 5. Examples Are Documentation

The best way to understand a module is to run its examples. Every skill must include working, runnable examples.

### 6. Evolve Continuously

AI capabilities change rapidly. The framework is designed for evolution:

- Modules are versioned (semver)
- Knowledge bases can be updated independently
- Pipelines can be reconfigured without rewriting skills

### 7. Open and Auditable

All skill modules, reference documents, and pipeline definitions should be:

- Version-controlled
- Human-readable
- Machine-parseable
- Open source where possible
