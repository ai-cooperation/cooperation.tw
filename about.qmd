## Who We Are

AI Cooperation is a practice system that helps individuals and organizations learn to collaborate, operate, and continuously evolve with AI.

We are **Operator Designers** — not tool vendors, not SaaS platforms, not prompt engineering courses.

## Our Mission

> Make AI an organizational capability, not just a tool.

We believe the biggest challenge in AI adoption isn't technology — it's **operation design**. Most organizations have access to powerful AI models, but lack the methodology to integrate them into real workflows.

AI Cooperation bridges this gap by providing:

1. **Methodology** — How to think about human-AI collaboration
2. **Framework** — How to architect AI-augmented processes
3. **Skill Modules** — Deployable, reusable AI capabilities
4. **Lab** — Safe environments for learning and experimentation
5. **Service** — Enterprise adoption support

## Our Principles

- **Not model-locked** — Works with any AI model
- **Not tool-locked** — No vendor dependency
- **Capability over automation** — We build human capability, not just automation
- **Open and auditable** — All skill modules are open source
- **Sustainable evolution** — Not a one-time deployment, but continuous growth
