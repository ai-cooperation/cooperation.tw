## The Challenge

We needed a PPTX template inspired by modern SaaS dashboard aesthetics — dark backgrounds, neon glow effects, and a futuristic feel. The reference was an n8n 2026 roadmap infographic with fluorescent color accents on a deep navy background.

The question: **Can PowerPoint natively render neon glow effects without resorting to raster images?**

## The Answer: `a:glow` XML

PowerPoint's OOXML format supports `a:glow` inside `a:effectLst` on any shape's `spPr`. This creates a soft halo around the shape's border:

```xml
<a:effectLst>
  <a:glow rad="75000">
    <a:srgbClr val="4ECDC4">
      <a:alpha val="40000"/>
    </a:srgbClr>
  </a:glow>
</a:effectLst>
```

Using `python-pptx` with `lxml`, we inject this XML into decorative shapes on each slide layout.

## Design Principle: Frames, Not Lines

Our initial approach used solid-fill rectangles (`add_rect`) with `a:glow`. This worked in PowerPoint but had a problem: **LibreOffice doesn't render `a:glow` on solid-fill shapes accurately**. The glow radius changes were nearly invisible in LibreOffice-exported PNGs.

The fix: replace all line/bar decorations with **thin hollow rounded-rect frames** (`add_neon_frame`). A neon frame is:

- No fill (`a:noFill`)
- Colored border (`a:ln` with `a:solidFill`)
- Glow on the border (`a:glow` in `a:effectLst`)

LibreOffice renders glow on bordered shapes much more faithfully than on filled shapes.

## The Roadmap Palette

| Element | Color | Hex |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Background | Deep navy gradient | `#0D1B2A` → `#1B2838` |
| Titles | Coral | `#FF6B6B` |
| Column headers | Gold | `#E8A838` |
| Accent / Frames | Teal | `#4ECDC4` |
| Body text | Bright white | `#F0F0F0` |

## Layout Decoration Rules

All 7 Pandoc PPTX layouts use neon frames exclusively:

- **Single-content layouts** (Title Slide, Title and Content, Section Header): Thin elongated frames mimicking decorative lines
- **Multi-column layouts** (Two Content, Comparison, Content with Caption): Normal-sized panel frames

This keeps the visual language consistent — every glowing element is structurally a frame.

## PNG Export Pipeline

For the website showcase, we convert PPTX slides to PNG images:

1. `build_template_roadmap.py` → `template-roadmap.pptx`
2. `quarto render` → `demo-roadmap.pptx`
3. `postprocess_demo.py` → fixes vertical centering
4. LibreOffice headless → PDF
5. `pdftoppm` → individual PNG per slide (200 DPI)

This pipeline runs locally. The PNGs are committed to the website repo and displayed in a JavaScript-powered slide gallery with keyboard navigation.

## Key Takeaway

Native OOXML effects (`a:glow`, `a:outerShdw`) are powerful but renderer-dependent. If your output needs to look consistent across PowerPoint, LibreOffice, and Google Slides, **use bordered hollow shapes** rather than solid-fill shapes as glow carriers. The border gives renderers a clear edge to apply the glow effect to.
