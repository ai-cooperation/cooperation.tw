## A Question You May Not Have Considered

When most people talk about AI, they talk about models, tools, and technology.

But the real question is: **Can you work with AI?**

Not "can you write prompts," but:

- Can you decompose a complex task into AI-executable steps?
- Do you know which parts to give AI and which to do yourself?
- Can you evaluate the quality of AI outputs?
- Can you design a process for AI to continuously improve?

If you find these questions hard to answer, what you need isn't a better AI tool — what you need is **AI Operation**.

## What is AI Operation?

> AI Operation is a systematic approach to designing how humans, AI, and processes collaborate.

It encompasses three core dimensions:

### 1. Task Design

Decompose complex work into AI-processable steps. Define inputs, outputs, and quality standards for each step.

### 2. Process Architecture

Design multi-step pipelines with AI execution steps and human review points. Manage state, handle errors, support iteration.

### 3. Capability Evolution

Encapsulate successful AI work patterns into reusable modules. Continuously update knowledge bases and quantify organizational AI maturity.

## An Example

Suppose you need to create a presentation.

**Without AI Operation**:
→ Open ChatGPT, say "make me a presentation about XX"
→ Get a bunch of text
→ Manually paste into PowerPoint
→ Spend hours formatting

**With AI Operation**:
→ Planner Agent analyzes requirements, produces structured spec (deck_spec.json)
→ Worker Agent generates correctly formatted QMD based on spec and layout rules
→ Pipeline automatically builds template, renders, and postprocesses
→ Outputs a professionally styled PPTX

The difference isn't AI's capability — it's **operation design**.
