## Overview

The AI Operation Framework provides a structured architecture for building, deploying, and evolving AI-augmented workflows.

## Key Concepts

### Skill Modules

Every AI capability is packaged as a **Skill module** — a self-contained unit with:

- **Contract** (`module.yaml`) — Inputs, outputs, dependencies, pipeline steps
- **Skills** — AI agent behavior specifications
- **Reference Docs** — Domain knowledge base
- **Tools** — Executable scripts and programs
- **Examples** — Working demonstrations

[View Skill Modules →](../skills/index.qmd)

### Pipeline Architecture

Complex tasks are broken into multi-step pipelines:

```
User Request
    ↓
[Planner Skill] → Structured Plan (JSON)
    ↓
[Worker Skill]  → Content Output (QMD, MD, Code...)
    ↓
[Tool Pipeline] → Final Artifact (PPTX, PDF, Deploy...)
    ↓
[Human Review]  → Approve / Iterate
```

Each step can be an LLM call (skill) or a tool execution (script).

### Knowledge Architecture

```
prompts/         → WHO the agent is (short, focused)
skills/          → WHAT the agent does (behavior spec)
reference/       → HOW to do it (domain knowledge)
tools/           → EXECUTE (scripts, CLIs)
```

**Key principle**: Skills point to reference docs. They don't inline detailed knowledge.
